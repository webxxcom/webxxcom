Welcome to My GitHub Profile
Hi there! I'm a developer with experience in various programming languages and tools. I focus on solving complex problems with efficient code, and I'm always looking to improve my skills through hands-on work and projects.

- **C++**: Focusing on advanced topics like std::ranges, perfect forwarding, and custom data structures (e.g., PtrArray class, iterators).
- **Java**: Working with object-oriented design, data manipulation, and various frameworks (e.g., Java I/O, SQL, JavaFX).
- **SQL**: Understanding MySQL databases, JOIN types, and creating efficient queries.
- **Web Development**: Exploring HTML/CSS for layout and form design (without relying on JavaScript or CSS frameworks).

- I prefer minimal loop usage and aim to use the simplest, most efficient constructs possible.
- I focus on optimizing algorithms, ensuring code clarity, and following best practices in both C++ and Java.
- Iâ€™m constantly learning new programming concepts, and I enjoy diving deep into technical topics like computer architecture and advanced data structures.
